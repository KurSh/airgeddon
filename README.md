##### Important tips about BeEF

 - The right software you must install is **BeEF** (Browser Exploitation Framework). Be careful, do not mistake it with **beef** (Flexible Brainfuck Interpreter). This package has the same name and executable file name on some distributions and can lead into confusion. Anyway, `airgeddon` is able to detect the issue and display a warning if needed. Here is a link to the right [BeEF installation's page].
 - If you are using a distribution which already has BeEF installed like Kali, BlackArch or Wifislax, there will be no problems. If you have manually installed BeEF, `airgeddon` is able to manage the integration asking for the path where it's installed, even modifying its own code in order to make updates-proof persistent changes.

##### Important tips about hashcat

`hashcat` is used to perform various attacks against captured files using the **CPU**.
In order to execute `hashcat`, you need to install an **OpenCL** runtime compatible with your hardware.

#### Update tools &#8592; Not necessary to work, only used for auto-update

 Command | Possible package name
:--------|:----------------------
 curl    | curl                  

#### Internal tools &#8592; These are internally checked. Not necessary to work, good to have

 Command  | Possible package name                  
:---------|:---------------------------------------
 xdpyinfo | x11-utils \| xdpyinfo \| xorg-xdpyinfo
 ethtool  | ethtool                                
 lspci    | pciutils                               
 rfkill   | rfkill                                 

It is highly recommended to have the internal tools installed. They improve functionality and performance. For example, `xdpyinfo` allows the script to detect the display resolution in order to print on windows in a better way (size and position).

Of course, the script also uses many standard basic tools that are supposed to be included in any Linux distribution, so they are not checked (cp, rm, grep, pgrep, egrep, md5sum, uname, echo, hash, cat, sed, etc.).

A command could be included in different packages, depending on the distribution.

---

### Usage

It is essential to run this script as **root**, otherwise `airgeddon` won't work properly.

<details open>
	<summary><strong>Getting Started</strong></summary>
	<ul>
		<li>Clone the repository</li>
		<ul>
			<li><code>git clone https://github.com/v1s1t0r1sh3r3/airgeddon.git</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Go to the newly created directory</li>
		<ul>
			<li><code>cd airgeddon</code></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Run it (remove <strong>sudo</strong> if you already have root permissions)</li>
		<ul>
			<li><code>sudo bash airgeddon.sh</code></li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</details>

`airgeddon` should be launched with **bash** `bash /path/to/airgeddon.sh` and not with `sh` or any other kind of shell. <br/>

If you launch the script using another shell, there will be *Syntax errors* and faulty results.
Even with no initial errors, they will appear later. Always launch with **bash**!

### Known Incompatibilities

- Incompatible with Mac OSX at the moment
 - *Bash version* &#8592; it can be avoided by upgrading it using `brew` or whatever, this is not the real problem :smile:
 - *Aircrack suite* &#8592; this suite does not support `airodump` and `aireplay` for OSX
 - *Wireless tools* &#8592; `iwconfig` does not exist in OSX, so `airport` command cannot be used. It generates different outputs
- Incompatible with OpenBSD and FreeBSD. They are Unix systems but they have some differences with Linux
 - *Bash* &#8592; They have no bash. It can be installed, this is not the real problem again :sweat_smile:
 - *Wireless tools* &#8592; `iwconfig` does not exist in these systems, they use `ifconfig` instead and it generates different outputs
